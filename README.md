# Academic Paper Retrieval using Transformers and Deep Learning

### In this project, using a dataset of academic paper consisting of 51773 papers' titles and abstracts, a search framework in designed. 
### First, a FastText embedding is generated for titles and abstracts. 
### Then, using 3 different approaches (Naive Bayes, Neural Network, and BERT), a classification model is trained and tested. 
### Moreover, a search system is also developed to retrieve query-related documents.
